☆ | what i'm working on (math and econ related)!!
i adore, adore matrices so much!! i'm currently working on a series of proofs for linear transformations, change of coordinate matrices, and other fun rank-nullity proofs for isomorphisms. as for economics, i'm currently invested in the more macroeconomic side of things, with interest rates and the fed. i especially love the intersection of intellectual property legislation and its effects on productivity and interest rates, so looking for a personal project w/ r on correlation!
